# Share Reddit

Share the meme image instead of just the link:

1. Share the link to shreddit
2. Shreddit downloads the image and prompts you where you want to share it to

## Beware

This app was created on a single evening, with Gin involved. It is not beautiful, it is the ugliest code I have written in the last few years, and it is likely that it does not work always. 

I wrote it for myself, I share it with you, but don't you expect any quality at all!
